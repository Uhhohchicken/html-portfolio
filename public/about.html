<h1>My name is Patrick Larue!</h1>

<p>I'm a dog dad of two and I love me some video games. When something is challenging it's difficult for me to walk away without it being completed. 
  Of course that depends on what that "something" is.
  I recently got into Web Development after I discovered how fun the process is, and that I could express my creativity while potentially helping others.</p>

<p>My passion for technology started at a very young age learning how to build a gaming PC along with the maintence and care needed for those PCs.
I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and practice of front end development.
