<h3>Gladiator</h3>
    <p>
        The action, the story, the message of honor and virtue is what makes this movie one of my top choices.
    No spoilers, but, honor always wins.

<h3>Oblivion</h3>
    <P>
        This is another movie that the story over exceeds expectiations. A si-fi movie filled with great action scenes, twists, and the delivery of a great message about selflessness.
    One of the best Tom Cruise movies (yes, Tom Cruise).
    </P>

<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
    <p>
        Revolves around the idea that our actions and choices ripple throughout time, impacting others in ways we may not foresee. 
    It explores how individuals and societies are shaped by their environments, relationships, and the quest for freedom and justice across different epochs.
    This film will have you reflecting on the interconnectedness of humanity and the enduring power of human spirit accross time and space.
